 Applied Data Science Project in Analyzing Success for a Venture Capital Investment Decision

---

## About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the success of investment decisions using structured startup data.The workflow involved cleaning and encoding raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, and engineering features based on key venture capital due diligence factors. Multiple predictive models, including Multiple Regression and XGBoost, are being developed and fine-tuned using cross-validation to optimize performance. Key findings and model results are visualized using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to ensure interpretability for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
